# A minimal GitHub Pages website

This website is generated by GitHub Pages with the absolute minimum of configuration
([View the source](https://github.com/mfisher87/simple-site)).
**You do not _need_ to know about static site generators (SSGs) like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to use GitHub pages.**
Under the hood, GitHub is using Jekyll to render this site.
If you want to get fancy, you might want to learn more about SSGs.

## Tutorial

**Step 1**:
Set your repository to deploy to GitHub Pages from the "main" (default) branch.
From your GitHub repository, navigate to "Settings" at the top navigation bar.
Then, select "Pages" from the left sidebar menu.
Finally, configure your build and deployment source to "Deploy from a branch", select
the "main" branch", and leave the folder set to "/ (root)".
Click "Save".

**Step 2**:
Create [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) content in your repository in an
`index.md` file, which will become the landing page of your GitHub pages site.

At this point, you should have a functional site! :tada:
The URL of your site can be viewed by clicking the "Edit repository details" button,
which is shown as a cog or gear icon (:gear:).
Within this menu, select "Use your GitHub Pages website", and click "Save changes".


**Step 3 (optional)**:

Create more pages as Markdown files.
At this point, you need some minor knowledge about Jekyll's syntax (Liquid).
Use [Jekyll's link syntax](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#link) to link any other pages, [like so]({% link ./README.md %}).

```markdown
... [like so]({% link ./README.md %}).
```
