# A minimal GitHub Pages website

This website is generated by GitHub Pages with the absolute minimum of configuration
([View the source](https://github.com/mfisher87/simple-site)).
**You do not need to know about static site generators (SSGs) like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Quarto](https://quarto.org) to use GitHub pages.**
If you want to get fancy, you might want to learn more about SSGs.

**Step 1**:
Set your repository to deploy to GitHub Pages from the "main" (default) branch.
From your GitHub repository, navigate to "Settings" at the top navigation bar.
Then, select "Pages" from the left sidebar menu. 
Finally, configure your build and deployment source to "Deploy from a branch", select
the "main" branch", and leave the folder set to "/ (root)".
Click "Save".

**Step 2**:
Create [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) content in your repository.
Start with `index.md`, which will be the landing page of your GitHub pages site.
Use relative links to any other pages or assets, [like so](./README).

```markdown
... [like so](./README).
```
